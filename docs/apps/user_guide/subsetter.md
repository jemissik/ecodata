# Subsetter

## Using the app

1. Paste the full filepath to a GIS dataset (e.g., a shapefile or filegeodatabase).
2. There are three options for subsetting: specifying bounding box coordinates, providing a movebank track dataset (in
which case the app will automatically draw a boundary around the track data), or providing a polygon to use as a
boundary. Select the option you want and the settings specific to that option.
3. By default, the app will plot the subsetted dataset once it is created, but if you don't want to plot the dataset,
uncheck the box for "Show plot of subset".
3. Change the name of the output file if you wish, then click "Create subset". A file will be saved for the subsetted
dataset, and a plot will appear unless you turned the plotting option off.
