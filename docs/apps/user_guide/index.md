# User guide

ECODATA-Prepare is a set of four Python-based apps to read, process, and create animations from animal tracking data and gridded environmental data. [Read here](https://ecodata-apps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for an overview and learn how to install, contribute and get support.

## Getting started

Before using this program, download a local copy of the tracking data you want to use, in Movebankâ€™s .csv format. It is possible to subset or combine data from different studies. Read the [installation instructions](../installation) to install or update the program.

Follow the instructions below to launch the program. A window will open on your default web browser, showing the app gallery. The apps are running locally at localhost:5006. *Note: Anaconda gives no indication the command is running. There may be a short wait (10+ seconds) before the window opens.*

When it opens, it will display the main panel, showing the four apps. Click on an app to launch it. From there, you can navigate between apps within the interface, or switch between them by pasting these URLs in your browser window:
http://localhost:5006: main panel
http://localhost:5006/tracks_explorer_app: Tracks Explorer App
http://localhost:5006/gridded_data_explorer_app: Gridded Data Explorer App
http://localhost:5006/subsetter_app: Subsetter App
http://localhost:5006/movie_maker_app: Movie Maker App
