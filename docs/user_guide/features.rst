Features
========

* Subsetting tool: Efficiently create subsets from very large geographic datasets, and visualize the results

* Convenience functions for getting information (e.g. metadata, number of records, coordinate system, spatial extent)
  from a large dataset without reading the dataset into memory

* File conversions

    * convert .grib files to netcdf files
    * convert a stack of geotiff files to a single netcdf (TODO)

* Data selection, resampling, and aggregation functions for spatial datasets

    * resample to different temporal and spatial resolutions (TODO)
    * spatial and temporal selections (TODO)
    * aggregation functions (TODO)
